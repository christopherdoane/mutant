# Mutant: User's guide

Hey there, great to have you here!
Thanks for taking the time to read this file.
The goal of this document is to:

  - introduce you to basic concepts of mutation testing,
  - help you run Mutant on your Clojure projects and understand results you'll
    see, and
  - discuss current limitations of Mutant.

Running Mutant is as simple as executing the one-liner you've seen in
[README.md][readme].
In this document we're going dig a bit deeper into the topic.
