# Mutant

A [mutation testing][wiki] library for Clojure.

> *tl;dr:* Mutant breaks your code and lets you know if your test suite is
> still green.

Mutant tries to break your code. It goes through your namespaces and
introduces changes to your sources. After each mutation it attempts to run
your test suite. If all tests still pass despite the mutation Mutant reports
the mutation as a survivor.

## Usage

Add the `lein-mutate` to in the `:plugins` vector of either your `:user` profile
or your project.clj. Make sure your test suite is green. Then run:

    $ lein trampoline mutate
